An app I'd love to build is a service app that helps hire services such as a electricians, plumbers, construction workers, etc. in Indonesia. There, a lot blue-collar laborers and service workers can be found through word of mouth, but it can be a hit or miss for a worker's reliabilty and capability. My app would help connect clients and laborers together under one platform. The goal of the app is to allow clients to see a laborer's services and their reviews and reccomendations; making it easier to determine whether they should hire them or not. Some feautres of the app, would include ability to post reviews and reccomendations, a progress bar with progress pics to show how far along the job is going, laborer's location on map relative to a client's home, etc. 

## Notes

The challenge I faced was getting trying to get rid of my initial UIButton as I used UIOutlet instead of UIAction. I used the apple guide and a quick google search to understand how I could disconnect the outlet and re-establish a new UIAction button.
